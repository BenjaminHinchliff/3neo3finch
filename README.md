# 3neo3finch

Modern (and hopefully final) Version of my Portfolio Website, built from the ground up with svelte.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> App is automatically deployed using vercel to [benjaminhinchliff.com](https://benjaminhinchliff.com/)
